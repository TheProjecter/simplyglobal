*SimplyGlobal*...
  * helps you create multilingual sites in rails
  * makes it easy to use different template files for different languages
  * uses multilingual file written in pure ruby... no database or yml files

==Why another plugin?==
The ones we tried were too hard to use, not easy to install or incomplete. *SimplyGlobal* is easy to use, easy to install and complete (for our needs).

== How to use it ==
  # [Install Install it]
  # Write [Routes routes]
  # Create [Templates templates]
