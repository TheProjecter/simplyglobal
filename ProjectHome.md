# NO MORE WORKING IN RAILS 2.3 #
# SimplyGlobal... #
  * helps you create multilingual sites in rails
  * makes it easy to use different template files for different languages
  * uses multilingual file written in pure ruby... no database or yml files

## Why another plugin? ##
The ones we tried were too hard to use, not easy to install or incomplete. **SimplyGlobal** is easy to use, easy to install and complete (for our needs).

## How to use it ##
  1. [Install it](Install.md)
  1. Write [routes](Routes.md)
  1. Create [templates](Templates.md)
  1. You are ready to [use it](How.md)
